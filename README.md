# Web Components Example

## Use
This repository can be used as a foundation for creating Web Components.   
The example demonstrates how to create a parent class that can be extended to create multiple Web Components.   
Web Components utilize a shadow DOM, which encapsulates styling, scripting, and events.   
Simply download all the files and open index.html in a modern browser.   

## Warnings
This example is still under development but is already functional for previewing how to create and use Web Components.
